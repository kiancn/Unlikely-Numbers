# Unlikely-Numbers
C# Console Program that can do binomial likelyhood math.
Created for excercise during a math course. It's works fine though, if you need exactly this kind of thing.

The package will open as Project Euler at the moment; this is because Unlikely Numbers forked from a set of math coding excercises that I was doing:
It's just a bunch of basic math. You can awake that part and have a look easily by uncommenting appropriate lines in the Main function.
